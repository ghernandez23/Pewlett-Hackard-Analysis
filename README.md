# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview  
I have been tasked with reviewing the dataset to determine the number of employees that will be retiring in the near future by gathering the name/title of all employees that were born between 1/1/52-12/31/55 so that Pewlett Hackard can begin the process of replacing said employees in a timely fashion. I have also been tasked with determining the employees that qualify for a mentorship program.

## Results
After reviewing the data I was able to determine the following:

- A total of 90,398 employees are eligible for retirement in the near future
- Majority of said employees of retirement age hold senior positions within the company
- A total of 1,549 employees qualify for the mentorship program 
- The number of retirement eligible employees significantly outweighs the amount eligible to mentor new hires within the company

## Summary
In conclusion, when the "silver tsunami" hits we can see that a total of 90,398 positions will become vacant and need to be filled. With so many senior employees leaving, I fear that we do not have enough employees remaining to train and mentor the massive wave of new employees in the near future. With only 1,549 employees remaining with the experience and knowledge to mentor, this is going to cause a major strain on these employees.
